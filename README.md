Hi there
Welcome to my gitHub account ðŸŽ‰ 
It's a project with using HTML, Css and Javascript
And I making this project with using tailwindCss too
It's very exciting for me
Because this is the first time I use tailwind
And I suggest you definitely use it
so let's start
you should first time make a html file like index.html
and you should make two part => 
1.Header 2.Main
and I think you know that
you can write header div or div with header class actually
so next step
you need use tailwind css a lot actually
so you should add it in you're index.html
you can use it's link or you can install that in you're project folder
this is link (https://tailwindcss.com)
and than
You should divide the header into three parts
left : the Amazon Logo
center : the search box
and right : you should put the cart and favorite(heart) and alarm and the last thing , you're logo and you can get it in this site (https://jdenticon.com/)
and you write the div with main class
You should divide the header into two parts again
1.main sidebar 
2.main section
and you should write and write , over and over
continue and try :)
so this was my first README
and I hope it's will be usefull for you
it's so easy and you make it, don't worry  
and I learn it with a good teacher 
and I will put video's link in this file
